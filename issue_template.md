Before You Start!

Please report only bugs or feature requests here.
We do not accept usage questions here and will close issues that do not conform to this requirement.
For documentation about DevTools, please head over to

Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.

Please understand that maintaining open source projects is hard work.
Firefox DevTools has limited maintainer bandwidth. That means the only way to ensure the project's sustainability is to improve issue triaging efficiency. Issues that do not provide proper information upfront usually result in inefficient back-and-forth communication to extract the basic information needed for actual triaging.
The details you will provide below is therefore very important to save time on both sides.
